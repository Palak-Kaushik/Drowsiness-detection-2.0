# Drowsiness-detection-2.0

# Description

The Driver Drowsiness and Uneasiness Detection System is designed to enhance road safety by using Computer Vision to alert drivers when they show signs of drowsiness or in case of severe medical emergencies like stroke, etc. This is done using dlib, a cross-platform software library, that uses pre-trained facial landmark detectors to estimate the location of 68 coordinates that map facial structures to draw predictions.

Beeping noise is produced to alert the driver if he/she is found to be drowsy or inactive for more than 3 seconds. A switch is provided that is to be turned off manually to stop the beep alert signal. In case of a medical condition, for example stroke, the driver becomes unconscious, the beeping of signal continues and an emergency help signal is sent to ambulance and other rescuing teams. The tail lights of car turns on and an alert signal is sent in all directions to alert the drivers against a possible road accident and take necessary precautions.
